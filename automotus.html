	Being lucky enough to still have living grandparents has often made me think about ways that I could spend more time with them. I recognize that not everyone is as lucky as I am. Although many of the elderly die due to natural causes, car crashes are the second leading cause of death among the elderly. As the age of a driver increases, the fatality rate increases. This can be attributed to increased likelihood of injury, dementia, and medical complications. Many others are not able to drive, causing them to be dependent upon others to participate in daily activities. This dependency can often lead to depression. I, for one, did not like the thought of my grandparentsâ€™ increased risk on the road, and I hope to find ways to help make them safe.
	<br>During the summer of 2016, at the Georgia Tech Summer Engineering Institute, I was able to find a solution to this problem. Two peers and I were able to create a way to decrease car crash fatalities among those age 65 and older. We created a self-driving car service called AutoMotus, specializing in providing safe and efficient transportation for the elderly. During the brainstorming process, I pictured my step-grandmother who had, at the time, suffered a stroke. She was unaware that she had had a stroke. It terrifies me to think about the fact that she could have gotten behind the wheel and would likely have been involved in an accident. I also thought of my grandmother who never learned how to drive. She is always dependent on my father to drive her to church, the grocery store, and other activities. I became determined to work toward a safer and more mobile existence for our loved ones.
