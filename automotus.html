	<strong>Project: </strong>AutoMotus
	<br><strong>Where: </strong>Summer Engineering Insitute at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia
	<br><strong>When: </strong>July 2016
	<br><strong>Description: </strong>
	Being lucky enough to still have living grandparents has often made me think about ways that I could spend more time with them. I recognize that not everyone is as lucky as I am. Although many of the elderly die due to natural causes, car crashes are the second leading cause of death among the elderly. As the age of a driver increases, the fatality rate increases. This can be attributed to increased likelihood of injury, dementia, and medical complications. Many others are not able to drive, causing them to be dependent upon others to participate in daily activities. This dependency can often lead to depression. I, for one, did not like the thought of my grandparents’ increased risk on the road, and I hope to find ways to help make them safe.
	<br>During the summer of 2016, at the Georgia Tech Summer Engineering Institute, I was able to find a solution to this problem. Two peers and I were able to create a way to decrease car crash fatalities among those age 65 and older. We created a self-driving car service called AutoMotus, specializing in providing safe and efficient transportation for the elderly. During the brainstorming process, I pictured my step-grandmother who had, at the time, suffered a stroke. She was unaware that she had had a stroke. It terrifies me to think about the fact that she could have gotten behind the wheel and would likely have been involved in an accident. I also thought of my grandmother who never learned how to drive. She is always dependent on my father to drive her to church, the grocery store, and other activities. I became determined to work toward a safer and more mobile existence for our loved ones.
	<br>To better demonstrate the AutoMotus solution, my team and I were tasked with designing a self-driving car. A prototype was created using EV3 Mindstorm robots to make the safest, most efficient and affordable car. The car went through five different designs; until we came upon the one that best suited our goals. The final design included a color sensor to detect different types of lines on the road. It would recognize when to turn, stop, or slow down. It was also equipped with an ultrasonic sensor which helped with detecting objects in front of the vehicle. The actual self driving car would be wheelchair accessible and included 911 alert software. It would also utilize satellite technology to navigate the roads. Fully equipped with these features, the price of the car would be $10,930, a comparable price to a used car, and an  affordable option for many.
	<br>The economical price of AutoMotus makes it a cost effective solution, not only for those over age 65, but it also creates an opportunity to provide solutions for socioeconomically under-resourced populations. For example, it could provide transportation to schools for children in developing countries. In these countries, schools are often located much farther away from lower-income populations, making it difficult to access education. My team hopes that the production and execution of this plan would result in a more educated, safe community for children and elders alike. Given the tremendous wealth disparity across many nations, it was not expected that many would be able to pay for our service. To me, this was an obstacle worth tackling. I created a plan to partner with the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The IRC is a non-profit organization based in Atlanta, Georgia that provides relief, respect, and renewal to victims of armed conflict around the world. Our self-driving car services will be made available to these people through the IRC and will be paid for using a portion of profits from our national sales.
	<br>So, while we initially considered AutoMotus as a single, economical solution to assist an aging population, it is also a solution for other global problems, like access to education for children in developing nations. More closely, taking part in this challenge has made me realize that I want to better people’s lives using technology.
